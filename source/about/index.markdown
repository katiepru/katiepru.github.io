My name is Kaitlin Poskaitis.  I am currently a sophmore at [Rutgers University](http://rutgers/edu). I am majoring in computer science and minoring in both math and economics.

I am currently employed at [Open System Solutions](http://oss.rutgers.edu) at Rutgers Univeristy as a student systems programmer.  I have many responsibilities at this job, including building RPMS, web design, and system administration.

I also have worked on several projects outside of school and work at hackathons. A few of these projects are listed below. My full [resume](/resume.pdf) is also availible.

- [Movies4L8tr](http://github.com/katiepru/Movies4L8tr) -- A hackathon project built at Fall 2012 HackRu. It is a simple website built using [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) as the backend as well as [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) for styling. It finds upcoming movies using the Rotten Tomatoes API, and allows users to sign up to recieve reminders when the movies are released via either email (via Sendgrid) or text (via Twillio) or both. MongoDB was used as the database to store user information, and this project won "Best MongoDB Hack".

- [2P Breakout](http://github.com/katiepru/2p_breakout) -- My first non-trivial program, this is a simple java game written in the first semester of my freshman year. Two players use different sides of the keyboard to control    paddles in the left and right of the board and try to destroy all the blocks in the center. Each player can only destroy blocks that match the color of their paddle. It uses the ACM library to create graphical objects. The image used for the ball and winning graphic are pictures of the class instructor.
